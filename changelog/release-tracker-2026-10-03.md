#### Behavior changes and removals
- The product now calls items OpenWork builds “artifacts” instead of “apps.”
- Browser login sync, its setup prompt, and its settings controls are removed; you can still sign in directly in the built-in browser.
- Slack replies are quiet by default while work runs; admins can turn progress updates back on. Slack now reports desktop handoff results and clearer completion messages.
- The new-task empty screen returns to its earlier layout, and Activity now focuses on member changes to models, skills, plugins, and connections rather than background system notices.
- Organization-managed Dashboards are no longer available by default; OpenWork staff must enable them for an organization. Existing dashboard data is retained while disabled.
- Auto availability and access changed: it is offered to eligible organization members, signed-out use is supported for clients, shared-network sign-out limits were removed, and deployments may explicitly disable it.
- Auto is no longer pinned by default in the model picker. Signed-out Auto uses updated access limits, and official builds remain usable unless a version is explicitly blocked.
- Admins choosing “Only models you provide” now prevent members from adding or using personal provider keys.
- Team organizations can now set up SSO. Routine plugin and connector management no longer prompts admins to re-confirm identity as often; sensitive settings retain their checks.
- The model picker removes Advanced options and presents effort and Fast choices directly in the picker.
- Self-hosters can deploy with Terraform modules and use an existing AWS ECS cluster; these modules are described as draft.
