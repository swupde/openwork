# OpenCode engine selection and history migration

The command palette offers **Switch to OpenCode v1**, **Switch to OpenCode v2**,
and **Migrate chats to OpenCode v2**. Advanced settings uses the same engine
commands. Both hand off to one app-wide owner (`shell/engine-migration.tsx`)
for the switch check, the migration consent, and migration progress, so a
migration stays visible after the surface that started it closes. Switching
engines never migrates history. V1 remains the default. Desktop packages include
both pinned native executables; v2's download fallback remains available for
standalone servers.

## Running tasks, switching, and migration progress

Before switching, the app reads `GET /experimental/engine-v2-preview/activity`
(counts only) for the engine being left. Running v1 tasks keep running unseen
after a switch to v2, and switching to v1 stops the v2 sidecar, so either case
asks first ("Switch anyway" / "Stop tasks and switch").

Migration consent names running v1 tasks the same way: a chat copied mid-turn
lands in v2 half-finished while v1 keeps running it. The server enforces this:
`POST …/migrate` answers 409 `engine_migration_active_sessions` while v1 reports
busy work, unless the request sets `allowActiveSessions: true` ("Migrate
anyway"). Engine switches during a migration answer 409
`engine_migration_running`.

While a migration runs, a modal shows progress. The person can choose
**Continue using OpenWork**, which leaves a top banner ("OpenWork may be
unstable until this finishes") with **Show progress**. Status reports a
`phase` (`starting`, `converting`, `copying`) and `startedAt`; the counts only
move while copying, so the bar is indeterminate before that instead of
showing a stalled "0 of N". A finished migration offers **Switch to OpenCode
v2**; one finished in the background reports with a toast instead. A failure
brings the dialog back with **Try again**, which skips chats already copied.

Session sync keys run state by workspace and session, not by engine, and
migrated chats keep their ids. A status read is therefore only adopted by the
engine it came from, a released sync for the other engine is disposed when
chats move to a new engine, and failed status reads back off instead of
polling an unreachable engine at 4 Hz.

Connect health and repair follow the active local engine. On v2, diagnostics
read native `/api/mcp` connection status and `/api/model` tool capabilities;
they do not look for the selected model in v1's catalog or require v1 plugin
canary tools. Remote workspace diagnostics remain with their owning server.
The connector parity proof checks health, repair, and real capability execution
on both engines.

## What migration does

Migration requires the OpenWork host token and explicit confirmation. It snapshots
the active profile's v1 SQLite database using SQLite backup (or `VACUUM INTO` on Bun), including committed
WAL writes, without modifying the original. A temporary, isolated instance of the
pinned v2 engine opens that snapshot and performs OpenCode's native conversion.
OpenWork waits for `/api/experimental/migration/v1` to report completion, then
exports converted chats and imports them into the existing v2 engine using its
native APIs. Parents precede children. Existing IDs return a conflict and are
skipped, so retries preserve v2 conversations and do not duplicate imports.
Temporary snapshots and the converter are cleaned up afterward.

Migration keeps the selected engine. It can partially complete if a chat fails;
retrying imports the remaining chats. Existing imported IDs are never overwritten,
so later edits in v1 do not sync. Active v1 tasks block the snapshot unless the
person chooses to migrate anyway.
The migration includes local history across workspaces in the active profile,
not history on connected remote servers. Development profiles remain isolated.

OpenCode's conversion resets session permissions and revert state, converts
interrupted tool activity, and may omit malformed rows or unsupported attachments.
Its transfer API exports settled messages. Review permissions before continuing
migrated chats. V1 plugin implementations require v2-compatible replacements;
this operation does not rewrite configuration, skills, or plugin files.

## Upstream contract reviewed

Implementation was checked against the published `@opencode-ai/core`,
`@opencode-ai/protocol`, and `@opencode-ai/server` packages at the repository pin,
`0.0.0-beta-19086`, and against the upstream v2 sources:

- [Native migration](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/v2/packages/core/src/database/v1-migration.bun.ts)
- [Migration status API](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/v2/packages/protocol/src/groups/migration.ts)
- [Native session transfer](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/v2/packages/core/src/session/transfer.ts)
- [V1 compatibility guide](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/v2/services/www/src/docs/content/migrate-v1.mdx)

## Verification

`apps/server/src/opencode-v2-migration.test.ts` checks WAL snapshots and missing
history. Its opt-in real-engine test creates v1 parent/child sessions, verifies
converted text, keeps an existing v2 chat, retries without duplicates, and checks
the source database hash. Run it with `OPENWORK_MIGRATION_LIVE_TEST=1`,
`OPENWORK_MIGRATION_V1_BIN`, and `OPENWORK_OPENCODE2_BIN` set to the pinned binaries.

The desktop `opencode-v2-chat-routing.e2e.test.ts` exercises both palette switches,
the warning and cancellation from settings and palette, and real chat turns on
both engines. UI consent/blocked/progress tests and desktop target mapping tests
also run in the core checks.

Design: P3 (details disclosure), P5 (existing ToggleGroup, Button, AlertDialog,
Dialog, Progress and Alert), P9 (migration data and risks), P10 (desktop
screenshots), P11 (no step labels; counts appear once they move), S2 (settings
rows), S6 (one owner for palette and settings), C1 (verb-first actions), C2
(Migrate → Migrated), C5 (running tasks are a warning, not an error), C6
(retryable errors).
