# Testing without blocking unrelated work

OpenWork has no package-level unit tests. All executable coverage lives in the
E2E journeys under `evals/specs` (see `evals/README.md`). Install both
workspaces with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and
`pnpm --dir evals install --frozen-lockfile` first. Use Node 24, Bun 1.3.14,
pnpm 11.4.0, and the OpenCode version in `constants.json` on PATH, matching CI.

## What blocks a merge

The `openwork-tests-required` check keeps its existing name and fails closed.
For ordinary code changes it requires two independent Linux jobs:

- **Core journeys:** the headless runner typecheck and the PR journeys selected
  by `pnpm --dir evals run test:core` (remembered thread approvals, effective
  permission attribution, PDF model routing, and session-list routing).
- **Packaging:** outbound-access declarations, the server's actual Node-target
  plugin build, Electron's IPC contract typecheck, and the packaged desktop
  smoke.

Model-snapshot-only and docs-only PRs keep their existing dedicated validation.
New commits cancel obsolete runs on the same PR. Dev pushes still run the core
and packaging checks.

To expand coverage, extend or add a journey in `evals/specs`. A failing journey
must be diagnosed and fixed, not retried until green or silently ignored.

## Broader coverage

The same workflow runs the test-framework checks (`pnpm evals:check`), all PR
specs (`pnpm evals:pr`), and the engine smoke (`pnpm test:e2e`) on Linux and
macOS at 07:37 UTC daily, or through **Run workflow** on a selected branch.
Packaging can be reproduced with `pnpm --filter openwork-server build` and
`pnpm --filter @openwork/desktop typecheck:electron`. Check the macOS nightly
before releases; it is not a PR prerequisite. The Daytona E2E and nightly
flake-report workflows are unchanged.

A skipped journey is incomplete coverage, even if a runner exits successfully.
Do not describe a run containing skips as full proof.

## Why this changed

An audit of OpenWork Tests runs created August 28–September 3, 2026 (UTC)
found 159 failures among 632 runs, including 17 awaiting approval. Among the
615 success/failure results, 25.9% failed. These are run counts, including
repeated branch updates, not a measured flake rate.

Sampled failure logs show different problems that need different fixes:

- [September 3](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/actions/runs/33814401384):
  `spec-impact` and `spec-quarantine` inventory assertions failed on both OSes
  while 115/116 other spec files passed. Those specific specs have since been
  removed; keeping test-framework bookkeeping out of the default gate prevents
  rebuilding the same barrier elsewhere.
- [August 28](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/actions/runs/33215552704):
  a compatibility spec spawned another test runner, obscuring the underlying
  failure behind a wrapper assertion.
- [PR #4442](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/pull/4442): the shared suite
  failed on the same engine-retirement timing assertion seen in a
  [dev run](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/actions/runs/33907568505).
  [PR #4439](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/pull/4439) independently
  repairs that race. Core coverage still exercises real engine eviction and
  reload behavior; the broad test is retained.
- The separate [SDK check on #4442](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork/actions/runs/33916924365)
  failed when schema generation connected to MySQL at `127.0.0.1:3306` without a
  database. That is a setup dependency to fix in the SDK change, not a reason
  to suppress schema-drift validation. This CI cleanup does not fix that branch.

This change adds no tests of tests and no new test files. Runtime savings must
be measured after rollout; reducing four broad PR jobs to two focused jobs is
not itself evidence of a particular wall-clock improvement.
