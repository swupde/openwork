const trust = `# Trust & Security

> How OpenWork handles data, what subprocessors are involved, and how to reach the security team.

## Key facts

- **Deployment** — self-hosted desktop app on your machines
- **Data storage** — local-only, nothing leaves your machine in desktop mode
- **LLM keys** — bring your own, sent directly to your provider
- **Telemetry** — none in desktop mode; opt-in feedback only
- **Incident SLA** — 72hr notify, 3-day ack, 7-day triage
- **Subprocessors** — 5 named vendors (cloud & website only)

## Data handling

| Data type | Self-hosted | Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| Source code | Local only | Accessed at runtime via your LLM provider; not stored |
| LLM API keys | Local keychain / env vars | Held by your LLM provider, not by OpenWork |
| Prompts & responses | Local only | Sent to your LLM provider; not logged by OpenWork |
| Usage telemetry | None | Anonymous via PostHog; can be disabled |
| Authentication | Your SSO / SAML | Google or GitHub OAuth |

## Subprocessors

- PostHog — analytics (US/EU)
- Polar — billing (US)
- Google — OAuth (US)
- GitHub — OAuth (US)
- Daytona — cloud sandbox infrastructure (EU)
