# Den API MCP Exposure Policy

The MCP catalog is generated from `openapi.json`, then filtered by `policy.ts` before tools are registered.

For third-party client setup and `invalid_target` troubleshooting, see
[Connect a third-party MCP client with OAuth](../../../../../docs/mcp-client-oauth.md).

## Allowed Tags

Every tagged Den API product surface is allowed unless it is listed under blocked tags or blocked operation IDs:

- `API Keys`
- `Capability Sources`
- `Config Objects`
- `Connectors`
- `Desktop Policies`
- `GitHub`
- `Invitations`
- `LLM Providers`
- `Marketplaces`
- `Members`
- `Organizations`
- `Plugins`
- `Roles`
- `Teams`
- `Users`
- `Worker Activity`
- `Worker Runtime`
- `Workers`

`Desktop Policies` reads require org admin; mutations require super-admin + Enterprise entitlement. Both are enforced in-route.

## Blocked Tags

These tags are intentionally excluded from MCP:

- `Admin`: internal administrative controls should not be broadly exposed as agent tools.
- `Authentication`: OAuth/session plumbing is used to authorize MCP, not exposed through MCP.
- `System`: health, docs, and other service metadata are not product actions.
- `Webhooks`: external webhook ingress routes require provider signatures and should not be invoked by agents.

## Blocked Paths

Routes are blocked if their path:

- starts with `/api/auth`
- contains `/admin`
- contains `/webhooks`

This catches auth/admin/webhook routes even if they are untagged or incorrectly tagged.

## Blocked Operation IDs

These individual operations are blocked even though their tags may otherwise be allowed:

- `postApiKeys`: creating API keys returns credentials and should stay behind explicit UI/API flows.
- `postV1ApiKeys`: generated OpenAPI ID for creating API keys.
- `deleteApiKeysByApiKeyId`: destructive credential revocation should stay behind explicit UI/API flows.
- `deleteV1ApiKeysByApiKeyId`: generated OpenAPI ID for deleting API keys, if present.
- `deleteOrg`: defensive block for organization deletion if a route is added.
- `deleteV1Org`: defensive block for organization deletion if a route is added.
- `deleteV1OrgsByOrgId`: defensive block for organization deletion if a route is added.
- `postWorkersByWorkerIdTokens`: worker token minting returns credentials and should stay behind explicit UI/API flows.
- `postV1WorkersByWorkerIdTokens`: generated OpenAPI ID for worker token minting.
- `postOauthProvidersByProviderIdDisconnect`: removing a connected OAuth credential is a mutation that should stay behind explicit UI/API flows, not an agent-callable tool.
- `postV1OauthProvidersByProviderIdDisconnect`: generated OpenAPI ID for disconnecting an OAuth provider.

## Untagged Operations

Untagged operations are excluded by default. Today these are OAuth/MCP discovery and registration routes, for example:

- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `/api/auth/oauth2/authorize`
- `/api/auth/oauth2/register`
- `/register`

They are required for OAuth/MCP setup, but should not appear as callable MCP tools.

### Apps as MCP servers

`create_app`, `update_app`, and `read_app` on `/mcp/agent` build Apps; they are
not App launch surfaces. Each App is a Plugin config object served as its own
MCP server at `/mcp/agent/connections/<appId>`, beside directly exposed
connections, so OAuth resource matching and desktop index reconciliation work
unchanged. That server lists only `open_app` (fixed `ui://` revision binding),
the App's declared tools, and its revision resources.

A declared tool binds one exact capability. Publishing resolves it as the
author, looking up only that capability (the Workflow, one connection's tool
list, or the Den operation), and stores its argument shape, input schema, and
read-only flag in the revision. Den and native GET operations and `live`
Workflows are read-only. A connection tool is read-only when its provider marks
it `readOnlyHint: true` and not destructive, as the author's tool list shows at
publish; search results carry the same `readOnly` label. Den and native writes
are refused as App tools; other connection tools and Workflow runs with input
are not read-only, so hosts ask before each call. The App server advertises the
flag, but every connection-tool call still needs `mcp:write`, as all external
dispatch does.

Calls run through the ordinary executor as the caller. `api` tools take
`{ path, query, body }` and are rechecked as GETs on every call; `mcp` tools
take the tool's own arguments and fail closed once the provider's input schema
no longer matches the published digest, or, for a read-only binding, once the
caller's live tool list no longer marks the tool read-only; the App then gets a
`policy_blocked` error naming its tool. Workflow tools take the Workflow's
input, and `live` ones run read-only with only an optional `timeZone`. Results
drop the `openwork/mcpApp` and `openwork/serverTools` hints, which name tools on
`/mcp/agent`. Plugin access is rechecked on every request; unavailable Apps
return a JSON-RPC error.

`create_app` and `update_app` add each bound Workflow to the App's Plugin and
route its tool through that Plugin, so sharing the Plugin shares the Workflows;
adding one requires Workflow manager access. `update_app` keeps omitted
`cssSource`, `description`, and `tools`, reusing stored bindings as published.

The Connect server index lists accessible Apps only to the App host
(`mcp-app-host-v1` with the app-host scope), with `exposeDirectly: false`, so
their tools never become model-facing servers. Apps fill only the room
connections leave under the desktop limit of 100. Search returns each App that
fits beside every usable connection as `kind: mcp_app`, and executing it returns
an `openwork/mcpApp` launch reference to the App's own server; an App past the
limit keeps its MCP URL but gets no launch.

Organization Dashboards can hold Apps too. `GET /v1/mcp-apps` lists the Apps
the calling admin can use in the dashboard element shape (`connectionId` is the
App id, `toolName` is `open_app`), which Den web's Add app picker offers as
"Apps built in OpenWork". Every dashboard read, including the desktop's
`GET /v1/me/dashboards`, serves such an element with the App's current
revision, so `update_app` never strands an assigned tile; a member still needs
the App's Plugin to open it.

Where `create_app` is available, Workflow-bound views are read-only:
`save_artifact_view` (create or edit), `activate_artifact_view_revision`, and
the REST save and activate routes return `legacy_view_read_only`. Existing views
keep their render, preview, run, and resource paths, and can still be retired.

Building your own Apps is off by default for every organization. A platform
admin turns it on per organization in /admin (the `appMcpServers` org
capability; only a literal `true` enables it). It also needs
`DEN_APP_MCP_SERVERS_ENABLED` (default `true`; `false`, `0`, `off`, or `no`
turns it off for the deployment) and the organization's member-facing MCP
connections. `appMcpServersEnabled` in `mcp-app-rollout.ts` combines the three,
and `GET /v1/org` reports the result as the `appMcpServers` capability. Where it
is off, an organization keeps the previous surface: no builder tools or App
servers, the original connection index and `save_artifact_view` guidance, and
writable Workflow-bound views. MCP Apps from connected MCP servers work either
way. Eval Dens that enable generated artifact views default the deployment flag
to `false` so older Workflow-bound journeys keep testing that mode.

### Live generated apps

GeneratedArtifactView.dataMode is optional on the wire. An absent value means
legacy snapshot; new save_artifact_view calls persist live by default.
The mode is immutable for a view. Migration 0101_artifact_view_data_mode
preserves existing rows as snapshots.

Live views expose run_artifact_<id> alongside render and preview tools.
All three execute the current saved Workflow as the authenticated caller,
using only exact declared capabilities whose current Den authority marks them
read-only. Normal explicit Workflow runs and Automation authority are unchanged.
A view's output schema must match the current version before execution.

The only live run argument is optional timeZone, an IANA zone, defaulting to
UTC. Desktop callers should supply Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone.
The Workflow receives input.runtime with now (ISO instant), today (YYYY-MM-DD),
timeZone, dayStart (ISO instant), and dayEnd (exclusive ISO instant). The server
computes these values for every run, including daylight-saving changes.
Author Workflow input schemas to accept that runtime object; example inputs
and creation dates are never reused. Arbitrary inputs and receipt overrides
are rejected.

GET /v1/apps/:appId also executes live views, accepts timeZone, and returns
Cache-Control: private, no-store. A failed run returns a null payload and an
optional structured runError, including connection status/card details when
available. MCP failures retain those details and connection cards.

Receipts, detail results, and snapshot pages are caller-private, including for
organization admins. Sharing an app shares the Workflow and view, never a
personal receipt. Explicit snapshot creation rejects capability-dependent
Workflows, including Google and other personal integrations. External metadata
hints cannot establish non-personal data. This contract does not provide a
cross-member snapshot-data sharing override; legacy snapshots and Automation
results remain readable by their own caller.
