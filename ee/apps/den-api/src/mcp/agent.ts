 *
 * `/mcp` (index.ts) stays exactly as it is — every catalog operation
 * individually registered, ~129 tools today. That's unchanged and still
 * useful for scripts/admin tooling that want to call a known operation by
 * name directly.
 *
 * `/mcp/agent` is a *different* endpoint for a *different* consumer: the
 * desktop app's "OpenWork Cloud Control" connection, which is what an
 * OpenCode/Claude Code/Codex-style harness actually sees. It always registers
 * `search_capabilities`, `execute_capability`, the direct skill tools
 * `list_skills` and `get_skill`, and `create_skill`, and
 * conditionally registers Code Mode and Artifact presentation tools. Workflows
 * remain discoverable and executable through the same capability-routing
 * tools instead of contributing separate contextual tools. The other ~127
 * operations are not individually callable on this endpoint.
