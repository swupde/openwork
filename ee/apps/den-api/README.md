# Den API

Hono-based Den control plane implementation (`den-api`, formerly `den-controller`).

This package is the active Den control plane implementation.

It carries the full migrated Den API route surface in a foldered Hono structure so agents can navigate one area at a time without scanning the whole service.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm --filter @openwork-ee/den-api dev:local
```

## Local demo org seed

With a local Den MySQL database running, seed a demo organization:

```bash
pnpm --filter @openwork-ee/den-api seed:demo-org
```

This creates `Acme Robotics` with demo users, teams, pending invites, and an imported Anthropic Knowledge Work Plugins marketplace. It is guarded by `OPENWORK_DEV_MODE=1`, defaults to the local Den DB URL, and does not create workers or active external integrations.

Default owner login: `alex@acme.test` / `OpenWorkDemo123!`.

## Observability

`DEN_OBSERVABILITY_BACKEND` selects one backend: `none`, `otel`, or `sentry`.

- `none` (default): structured JSON logs are written to stdout.
- `otel`: initializes the OpenTelemetry Node SDK before Hono/DB imports, exports OTLP HTTP/protobuf traces, metrics, and logs from standard `OTEL_*` variables, and uses `@hono/otel` for normalized request spans/metrics without inbound HTTP auto-instrumentation.
- `sentry`: initializes `@sentry/hono/node` before app imports and uses the official Hono middleware for errors/tracing/Sentry Logs. Do not combine it with the OTEL backend.

The request access log records request id, method, normalized route, status, and duration, and omits health/readiness noise. Health/readiness requests also skip den-api's Hono observability middleware. Authorization, cookie, body, and query values are redacted from app telemetry. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` overrides the default `den-api` service name. Daytona's own OTEL bootstrap remains disabled; do not set Daytona OTEL enable variables from den-api.

Builds generate source maps. Sentry source maps are uploaded only when `DEN_OBSERVABILITY_BACKEND=sentry` and `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, and `SENTRY_RELEASE` are present; `SENTRY_DIST` is passed through when set. The auth token must stay in secret storage and is never written to env examples or logs.

## Current routes

- `GET /` -> `302 https://openworklabs.com`
- `GET /health`
- Better Auth mount at `/api/auth/*`
- desktop handoff routes under `/v1/auth/*`
- current user routes under `/v1/me*`
- organization routes under `/v1/orgs*`
- active-organization SCIM management routes under `/v1/scim*`
- admin routes under `/v1/admin*`
- worker lifecycle and billing routes under `/v1/workers*`

## Folder map

- `src/routes/auth/`: Better Auth mount + desktop handoff endpoints
- `src/routes/me/`: current user and current user's org resolution routes
- `src/routes/org/`: organization CRUD-ish surfaces, split by area
- `src/routes/admin/`: admin-only reporting endpoints
- `src/routes/workers/`: worker lifecycle, billing, runtime, and heartbeat endpoints
- `src/middleware/`: reusable Hono middleware for auth context, org context, teams, and validation
- `src/cache.ts`: shared Redis-backed read-through cache. Add expensive read helpers here, keyed as `cache:${cacheParent}:${cacheChild}:${id}`; for example `cache.auth.session(token)` and `cache.org.members(orgId)`. Redis is optional, so every helper must fall back to the DB loader.

Each major folder also has its own `README.md` so future agents can inspect one area in isolation.

## Shared query cache

Use `src/cache.ts` for Den API read-through Redis caching. Do not create ad-hoc Redis calls in route handlers or domain modules.

Current public helpers:

```ts
const session = await cache.auth.session(token)
const members = await cache.org.members(orgId)
```

Cache key format:

```txt
cache:${cacheParent}:${cacheChild}:${id}
```

Example key:

```txt
cache:auth:session:<token>
cache:org:members:org_...
```

Rules for adding cache helpers:

- Add helpers under the exported `cache` namespace in `src/cache.ts`.
- Keep each helper as a read-through function: check Redis, run the DB loader on miss, write Redis, then return the loaded value.
- Redis is optional. Helpers must work when `DATABASE_REDIS_URL` is unset.
- Non-local Redis should use `rediss://`. Set `DATABASE_REDIS_ALLOW_INSECURE_INTERNAL=1` only when the `redis://` endpoint is private, non-public, and restricted to a trusted internal network.
- Use short TTLs unless invalidation is explicit and tested.
- Auth sessions are DB-authoritative and cached for at most one hour. Any session delete or identity-changing update must invalidate `cache.auth.deleteSession(token)`.
- Do not add new security-critical cache helpers without explicit invalidation and tests.
- Prefer names that read like domain calls, for example `cache.auth.session(token)` or `cache.org.members(orgId)`.

## SCIM existing-user adoption

The SCIM plugin in `src/auth.ts` requires existing membership in the connector's
organization before adopting an existing account. Its `shouldLinkUser` callback
also performs an uncached membership read by normalized user and organization
IDs with `removed_at IS NULL`. Better Auth 1.7.0-beta.10's built-in membership
lookup does not exclude removed rows, so both checks must remain enabled.
Invitations without a joined user, removed memberships, outside-org accounts,
and tokens without an organization cannot authorize adoption. No email-domain
exception applies. Successful adoption preserves the user ID and membership role;
the new-user provisioning path is unchanged.

The plugin evaluates this policy **before** its account-creation transaction.
The fresh read excludes already-removed memberships, but does not serialize a
concurrent removal with linking. Closing that race requires transactional policy
support in the plugin; this callback is not an atomic membership lock.

Run the installed-plugin regression suite in its own Node process:

```bash
pnpm --filter @openwork-ee/den-api test:scim-existing-user-linking
```

It uses Better Auth's memory adapter and compiles the membership SQL without
executing it. It does not import Den's full auth graph, start MySQL, configure
OAuth, or require real credentials.

## TypeID validation

- Shared Den TypeID validation lives in `ee/packages/utils/src/typeid.ts`.
- Use `typeId.schema("...")` or the compatibility helpers like `normalizeDenTypeId("...", value)` when an endpoint accepts or returns a Den TypeID.
- `ee/apps/den-api/src/openapi.ts` exposes `denTypeIdSchema(...)` so path params, request bodies, and response fields all share the same validation rules and Swagger examples.
- Swagger now documents Den IDs with their required prefix and fixed 26-character TypeID suffix, so invalid IDs fail request validation before route logic runs.

## OpenAPI contract

- `packages/docs/openapi.json` is the published contract, regenerated with `pnpm api:snapshot` and linted with `pnpm api:lint` (Spectral, ruleset in `.spectral.yaml`). The API Contract workflow fails on snapshot drift, on any lint error, and when warnings exceed `.spectral-baseline.json`.
- Every route registration carries a `describeRoute()` with `summary`, `tags`, `security` and `responses`; conventions and documented exceptions are in [`docs/api-style.md`](../../../docs/api-style.md).

## Migration approach

1. Keep `den-api` (formerly `den-controller`) as the source of truth for Den control-plane behavior.
2. Add endpoints in focused Hono route groups one surface at a time.
3. Reuse shared middleware and Zod validators instead of duplicating request/session/org plumbing.
4. Leave a short README in each route area when the structure changes so later agents can recover context fast.
