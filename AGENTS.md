## SwitchUp fork operations

For work in `swupde/openwork`, read [docs/SWUP-FORK.md](docs/SWUP-FORK.md)
before changing CI, importing upstream releases, or publishing artifacts.
Target this fork's `dev` branch for maintenance PRs. The upstream product
instructions below do not authorize adopting upstream infrastructure:
Warden, Blacksmith, Daytona, and public desktop publishing are not required
for SwitchUp's normal deployment. Recheck GitHub workflow enablement after
each upstream merge; new workflow files can become active on registration.
Production configuration and deployment belong to `swup-ai-workspace` and
Dokploy. Verify runtime state separately from successful CI or publication.

OpenWork is a free, open-source desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux) for doing
work with AI agents on your own files — an open-source alternative to Claude
Cowork and Codex, built on OpenCode, running any model from 50+ providers.
Desktop mode keeps files local; cloud is optional. Three surfaces live in this
repo:

* **Desktop app** (`apps/`, `packages/`) — local-first agent workspace: chat on
  files, skills, browser automation, scheduled automations, Anthropic-compatible
  plugins.
* **OpenWork MCP gateway** (`ee/apps/den-api`) — one URL
  (`api.openworklabs.com/mcp/agent`) that brings org-assigned skills, plugins,
  and connections (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, MCPs) into Codex, Claude
  Code, Cursor, or any MCP client via `search_capabilities` /
  `execute_capability`.
* **OpenWork Den** (`ee/apps/den-*`) — the org control plane: provision
  inference, manage teams and access, set desktop policies, publish skills and
  plugins through marketplaces.

The app consumes OpenWork server surfaces (self-hosted or hosted) rather than
inventing parallel behavior. Anything OpenCode can do is available in OpenWork,
even before a dedicated UI exists.

## Confidentiality (hard rule — this repo is public)

Never let a branch name, commit, PR text, comment, fixture, or evidence identify
a customer, prospect, partner, or outside person; use internal ticket IDs, and
escalate any leak instead of rewriting history.

## Coding

* pnpm only, never npm/yarn. TypeScript: never `any`, typecasts, or `as` unless
  100% necessary or instructed.
* Prefer Tailwind, React, shadcn/ui (Base UI), TanStack Query, Zustand, Zod,
  Drizzle, Better-Auth. Reuse `@/components`; end users are non-technical.
